This is a collaborative project between me and Coco!

purely trying out on my own, i think after modifying this doc, I'll need to commit the changes and leave a message

now we are trying with another txt file in common directory
trying to use git -a

writing something new
test to see if we can push this change to github. took a long time to connect local git with github
By definition git is working locally as a version control system, must sync with github, those online cloud
